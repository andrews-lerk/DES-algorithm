# DES algorithm
### A simple implementation of the world's first block encryption algorithm

The program receives messages consisting of ***ASCII characters*** and a ***64-bit key 
(maximum 8 ASCII characters).*** 

After the algorithm runs, a binary string is returned that contains a cipher, 
it can be passed to the decryption function.
